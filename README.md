# AI Loss Function Visualizer

An interactive PyTorch-based tool to visualize and compare how different loss functions affect model convergence and decision boundaries.

## Features
- Compares Binary Cross-Entropy, Mean Squared Error, and Hinge Loss
- Visualizes decision boundaries for each loss function
- Displays loss curves over training epochs
- Beginner-friendly PyTorch codebase, easy to expand

## Structure
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for demos
- **src/**: Modular Python scripts for data, models, training, and visualization
- **requirements.txt**: Install dependencies

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-loss-visualizer.git
cd ai-loss-visualizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
